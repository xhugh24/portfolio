        <div id="heroMotto" class="hero-motto">
            <h2><span class="highlight">Hero and Personal Motto</span></h2>
            <p><strong>Hero:</strong> General Norman Schwarzkopf</p>
            <p><strong>Why?:</strong> General Norman Schwarzkopf, also known as "Stormin' Norman," was a highly respected U.S. Army general who led the coalition forces during Operation Desert Storm. His strategic leadership and decision making made him a great figure. Schwarzkopf's ability to coordinate and lead a multinational force in a difficult conflict made him a respectable military general.</p>
            <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong> "The truth of the matter is that you always know the right thing to do. The hard part is doing it." – General Norman Schwarzkopf</p>
            <p><strong>Personal Motto:</strong> "The most important thing is to keep going until there is nothing left to do" - Bryan Jones.</p>

        <!-- personality test section -->

            <h2><span class="highlight">My Personality Test Result</span></h2>
            <img src="../Assets/personalitytest.jpeg" alt="Personality Type: ISTP" style="width: auto; height: auto;">
            <p class="summary">I took the All-In-One Personality Test on SimilarMinds, which showed that I’m primarily introverted (65%) and logical (73%), favoring reason over emotions in decision-making. The test also identified me as an ISTP (Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving), meaning I prefer independent, hands-on problem-solving. I scored highest in being easygoing (88%) and sectarian (100%), suggesting I value personal freedom but stay true to my beliefs.</p>
            <p class="summary">The Enneagram labeled me as Type 5 (Investigator, 69%), highlighting my love for deep knowledge. I find the test valid for understanding my traits, though it doesn’t capture all aspects of who I am.</p>
            <p class="summary">Overall, I think the test has validity in providing a broad overview of my personality and tendencies. It helped me recognize some aspects of myself that I may not always see on the surface, but I also believe that the test is just a starting point and doesn't fully capture the complexity of my individual character.</p>
